# Everyday Types



## Most Common Types
| Types       | Examples |
| ----------- | ---- |
| string      |  ``const hello: string = "Hello, world"`` |
| number      |  ``const num: number = 42`` |
| boolean     |  ``const active: boolean = true`` |
| Array       |  ``const numbers: Array<number> = [1 ,2 ,3]`` |

### The primitives : string ,number and boolean

- string represents string values like "Hello, world"
- number is for numbers like 42.
- boolean is for the two values true and false

> The type names ``String``, ``Number``, and ``Boolean`` (starting with capital letters) are legal, but refer to some special built-in types that will very rarely appear in your code. Always use ``string``, ``numbe``r, or ``boolean`` for types.

### Arrays

To specify the type of an array like ``[1, 2, 3]``, you can use the syntax ``number[]`` or ``Array<number>``.

### any
When a value is of type ``any``, you can access any properties of it (which will in turn be of type any), call it like a function, assign it to (or from) a value of any type, or pretty much anything else thatâ€™s syntactically legal.

```ts
let obj: any = { x: 0 };
// None of the following lines of code will throw compiler errors.
// Using `any` disables all further type checking, and it is assumed 
// you know the environment better than TypeScript.
obj.foo();
obj();
obj.bar = 100;
obj = "hello";
const n: number = obj;
```
#### noImplicitAny
In some cases where no type annotations are present, TypeScript will fall back to a type of any for a variable when it cannot infer the type.

Turning on ``noImplicitAny`` however TypeScript will issue an error whenever it would have inferred any.
