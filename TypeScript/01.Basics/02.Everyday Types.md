# Everyday Types



## Most Common Types
| Types       | Examples |
| ----------- | ---- |
| string      |  ``const hello: string = "Hello, world"`` |
| number      |  ``const num: number = 42`` |
| boolean     |  ``const active: boolean = true`` |
| Array       |  ``const numbers: Array<number> = [1 ,2 ,3]`` |

### The primitives : string ,number and boolean

- string represents string values like "Hello, world"
- number is for numbers like 42.
- boolean is for the two values true and false

> The type names ``String``, ``Number``, and ``Boolean`` (starting with capital letters) are legal, but refer to some special built-in types that will very rarely appear in your code. Always use ``string``, ``numbe``r, or ``boolean`` for types.

### Arrays

To specify the type of an array like ``[1, 2, 3]``, you can use the syntax ``number[]`` or ``Array<number>``.

### any
When a value is of type ``any``, you can access any properties of it (which will in turn be of type any), call it like a function, assign it to (or from) a value of any type, or pretty much anything else that’s syntactically legal.

```ts
let obj: any = { x: 0 };
// None of the following lines of code will throw compiler errors.
// Using `any` disables all further type checking, and it is assumed 
// you know the environment better than TypeScript.
obj.foo();
obj();
obj.bar = 100;
obj = "hello";
const n: number = obj;
```
#### noImplicitAny
In some cases where no type annotations are present, TypeScript will fall back to a type of any for a variable when it cannot infer the type.

Turning on ``noImplicitAny`` however TypeScript will issue an error whenever it would have inferred any.

### Functions

When you declare a function, you can add type annotations after each parameter to declare what types of parameters the function accepts. Parameter type annotations go after the parameter name:
```ts
// Parameter type annotation
function greet(name: string) {
  console.log("Hello, " + name.toUpperCase() + "!!");
}

// Would be a runtime error if executed!
greet(42);
//Argument of type 'number' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'.
```
#### Return Type Annotations
You can also add return type annotations. Return type annotations appear after the parameter list:
```ts
function getFavoriteNumber(): number {
  return 26;
}
```
### Object Types

```ts
// The parameter's type annotation is an object type
function printCoord(pt: { x: number; y: number }) {
  console.log("The coordinate's x value is " + pt.x);
  console.log("The coordinate's y value is " + pt.y);
}
printCoord({ x: 3, y: 7 });
```
Here, we annotated the parameter with a type with two properties - ``x`` and ``y`` - which are both of type ``number``. You can use ``,`` or ``;`` to separate the properties, and the last separator is optional either way.

### Optional Properties

Object types can also specify that some or all of their properties are optional. To do this, add a ``?`` after the property name:
```ts
function printName(obj: { first: string; last?: string }) {
  // ...
}
// Both OK
printName({ first: "Bob" });
printName({ first: "Alice", last: "Alisson" });
```
In JavaScript, if you access a property that doesn’t exist, you’ll get the value ``undefined`` rather than a runtime error. Because of this, when you read from an optional property, you’ll have to check for undefined before using it.

```ts
function printName(obj: { first: string; last?: string }) {
  // Error - might crash if 'obj.last' wasn't provided!
  console.log(obj.last.toUpperCase());
Object is possibly 'undefined'.
  if (obj.last !== undefined) {
    // OK
    console.log(obj.last.toUpperCase());
  }
 
  // A safe alternative using modern JavaScript syntax:
  console.log(obj.last?.toUpperCase());
}
```
### Union Types

TypeScript’s type system allows you to build new types out of existing ones using a large variety of operators. Now that we know how to write a few types, it’s time to start combining them in interesting ways.

```ts
function printId(id: number | string) {
  console.log("Your ID is: " + id);
}
// OK
printId(101);
// OK
printId("202");
// Error
printId({ myID: 22342 });
//Argument of type '{ myID: number; }' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string | number'.
```
#### Type Aliases

We’ve been using object types and union types by writing them directly in type annotations. This is convenient, but it’s common to want to use the same type more than once and refer to it by a single name.
```ts
type Point = {
  x: number;
  y: number;
};
 
function printCoord(pt: Point) {
  console.log("The coordinate's x value is " + pt.x);
  console.log("The coordinate's y value is " + pt.y);
}
 
printCoord({ x: 100, y: 100 });
```
### Interfaces
An interface declaration is another way to name an object type:

```ts
interface Point {
  x: number;
  y: number;
}
 
function printCoord(pt: Point) {
  console.log("The coordinate's x value is " + pt.x);
  console.log("The coordinate's y value is " + pt.y);
}
 
printCoord({ x: 100, y: 100 });
```
> #### Differences Between Type Aliases and Interfaces
> Type aliases and interfaces are very similar, and in many cases you can choose between them freely. Almost all features of an ``interface`` are available in ``type``, the key distinction is that a type cannot be re-opened to add new properties vs an interface which is always extendable.

### Type Assertions
Sometimes you will have information about the type of a value that TypeScript can’t know about.

For example, if you’re using ``document.getElementById``, TypeScript only knows that this will return some kind of ``HTMLElement``, but you might know that your page will always have an ``HTMLCanvasElement`` with a given ID.

```ts
const myCanvas = document.getElementById("main_canvas") as HTMLCanvasElement;
```
or
```ts
const myCanvas = <HTMLCanvasElement>document.getElementById("main_canvas");
```

>Reminder: Because type assertions are removed at compile-time, there is no runtime checking associated with a type assertion. There won’t be an exception or null generated if the type assertion is wrong.

### Literal Types

In addition to the general types ``string`` and ``number``, we can refer to specific strings and numbers in type positions.
```ts
let changingString = "Hello World";
changingString = "Olá Mundo";
// Because `changingString` can represent any possible string, that
// is how TypeScript describes it in the type system
changingString;

let x: "hello" = "hello";
// OK
x = "hello";
// ...
x = "howdy";
//Type '"howdy"' is not assignable to type '"hello"'.
```
But by combining literals into unions, you can express a much more useful concept - for example, functions that only accept a certain set of known values
```ts
function printText(s: string, alignment: "left" | "right" | "center") {
  // ...
}
printText("Hello, world", "left");
printText("G'day, mate", "centre");
//Argument of type '"centre"' is not assignable to parameter of type '"left" | "right" | "center"'.
```
or
```ts
function compare(a: string, b: string): -1 | 0 | 1 {
  return a === b ? 0 : a > b ? 1 : -1;
}
```
you can combine these with non-literal types:
```ts
interface Options {
  width: number;
}
function configure(x: Options | "auto") {
  // ...
}
configure({ width: 100 });
configure("auto");
configure("automatic");
//Argument of type '"automatic"' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Options | "auto"'.
```

### Literal Inference
There are two ways to work around this.
```ts
1 :
// Change 1:
const req = { url: "https://example.com", method: "GET" as "GET" };
// Change 2
handleRequest(req.url, req.method as "GET");

2:
const req = { url: "https://example.com", method: "GET" } as const;
handleRequest(req.url, req.method);
```
You can use ``as const`` to convert the entire object to be type literals.

### null and undefined

JavaScript has two primitive values used to signal absent or uninitialized value : ``null`` and ``undefined``.

### strictNullChecks
With ``strictNullChecks`` on, when a value is ``null`` or ``undefined``, you will need to test for those values before using methods or properties on that value.

```ts
function doSomething(x: string | null) {
  if (x === null) {
    // do nothing
  } else {
    console.log("Hello, " + x.toUpperCase());
  }
}
```
### Non-null Assertion Operator (Postfix!)

TypeScript also has a special syntax for removing ``null`` and ``undefined`` from a type without doing any explicit checking. Writing ``!`` after any expression is effectively a type assertion that the value isn’t ``null`` or ``undefined``:
```ts
function liveDangerously(x?: number | null) {
  // No error
  console.log(x!.toFixed());
}
```
