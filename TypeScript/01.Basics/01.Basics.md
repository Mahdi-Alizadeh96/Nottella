# The Basics

### install Type Script

```bash
npm install -g typescript
```

> This installs the TypeScript Compiler tsc globally. You can use npx or similar tools if youâ€™d prefer to run tsc from a local node_modules package instead


### tsc

We can compile our TypeScript file to JavaScript with ``tsc app.ts`` command.

### noEmitOnError


you may want to be a bit more defensive against mistakes, and make TypeScript act a bit more strictly. In that case, you can use the **noEmitOnError** compiler option. Try changing your ``hello.ts`` file and running ``tsc`` with that flag:

```sh
tsc --noEmitOnError hello.ts
```
